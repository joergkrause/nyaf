## Try **nyaf**

**nyaf** has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much **nyaf** as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of **nyaf**, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex **nyaf**-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

## Online Playgrounds

If you’re interested in playing around with **nyaf**, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, Glitch, or Stackblitz.

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.

## Add **nyaf** to a Website

You can add **nyaf** to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich **nyaf** ecosystem. Learn how.
