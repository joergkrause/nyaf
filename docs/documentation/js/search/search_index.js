It's simple, has a flat learning curve, doesn't need any special tools.\nIdea\n\nI want to use JSX/TSX syntax for quick component dev.\nI want to use any current HTML 5 API, such as web components, fetch, and all this with ES2015.\nI want to have a simple template language, that avoids clunky map, reduce, filter stuff within the HTML.\nI want to use TypeScript from the beginning.\nI want to have a very small package.\nI want to use webpack and other common tools.\nI want to use decorators for controlling stuff, not code within  the component.\n\nApproach\nI'm using TSX. I don't use React, though. So it's just a feature of the TypeScript compiler.\nExcerpt from tsconfig.json:\n~~~\n\"jsx\": \"react\",\n\"reactNamespace\": \"JSX\",\n~~~\nA class JSX is the core, it handels the element definitions and extract the template extensions.\nTemplate Features\nn-repeat, n-for\nRepeats the element. The argument must be an array.\nAssume we have this object:\n~~~\n{ text: string, content: string }\n~~~\nIn an array like this:\n~~~\n[\n  {\n    text: \"hallo\", \n    content: \"Hello NYAF\" \n  }, \n  { \n    text: \"world\", \n    content: \"This is really nice\" \n  }\n]\n~~~\nThan you show the data on screen like this:\n~~~\n\n~~~\nThe array shall contain objects. If the property is needed, it's accessible withing any attribute by writing @propName.\n\nn-repeat is an alias.\n\nn-if, n-else\nThe value will be evaluated and the element does or does not render, then:\n~~~\n\n  Any content will not render if container doesn't render\n\n~~~\n\nIf there is an else-branch it can direct to a slot template.  elements are native web component parts.\n~~~\n\n  Any content will not render if container doesn't render\n\n\n  This is shown instead.\n\n~~~\n\nn-hide, n-show\nWorks same as n-if, but just adds an inline style display: none or not if true (n-hide) or false (n-show).\nn-on-[event]\nEvents are easy to ad directly using it like n-on-click. All JavaScript events are supported. Just replace 'click' in the example with any other JavaScript event.\n~~~\n this.clickMe()}>OK\n~~~\n\nThere is no bind necessary, events are bound to component anyway.\n\nYou can get the (original HTML 5 API) event using a parameter, like e in the example below:\n~~~\n this.clickMe(e)}>OK\n~~~\nComponents\nRegistration\nWeb Components must be registered. To support this, I use decorators:\n~~~\n@CustomElement('app-main')\nexport class MainComponent extends BaseComponent {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  protected render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        Demo\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n~~~\nThe name is determined by @CustomElement('app-main').\nIn main.ts call this:\n~~~\nglobalProvider.bootstrap({\n  components: [ButtonComponent, TabComponent, TabsComponent, MainComponent]\n});\n~~~\nThat's it, the component works now.\nRouter\nEverybody want's a SPA (Single Page App). Hence we need a router. The included router is very simple.\nFirst, define an outlet where the components appear:\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nAny kind of parent element will do. The router code sets the property innerHTML. Components, that are being used to provide router content need registration too. The also must have a name, because that's the way the router internally activates the component.\nRegister Routes\nThe following code shows how to register routes:\n~~~\nlet routes = {\n  '/': { component: DemoComponent },\n  '/about': { component: AboutComponent },\n  '/demo': { component: DemoComponent },\n  '/contact': { component: ContactComponent },\n};\nglobalProvider.bootstrap({\n  components: [ButtonComponent, TabComponent, TabsComponent, MainComponent],\n  routes: routes\n});\n~~~\nUse Routes\nTo activate a router you need a hyperlink. The router's code looks for a click onto an anchor tag. An appropriate code snippet to use the routes looks like this:\n~~~\nHome\nAbout\nDemo\nContact\n\n~~~\n\nPlease note the hash sign (#). It's required. No code or strategies here, write it by yourself and the enjoy a very small footprint of the supporting code.\n\nPro Tip! Import the router definition and use additional fields to create a menu directly from router configuration.\n\nShadow Dom\nBy default a shadow dom is used. That means, styles are isolated. No global styles are available.\nOne option:\n~~~\n@ShadowDOM()\n~~~\n\nUse Shadow DOM\nall global styles are still working (auto copy)\n\nThe property can be set explicitly. The default is false, hence if the decorator is being omitted, the component is not shadowed.\n~~~\n@ShadowDOM(true | false)\n~~~\nAnother interesting option controls the style behavior:\n~~~\n@UseParentStyles()\n~~~\n\nUse Shadow must be set, otherwise the decorator dows nothing\ncopies all global styles into component so they work as expected even in Shadow DOM\n\n\nIt's a trade-off. Shadow DOM increases performance and brings isolation. Copying many styles decreases performance and contradicts isolation.\n\nProperties\nTo use properties, you can define those.\n~~~\n@CustomElement('app-main')\n@Properties({ title: 'Default' })\nexport class MainComponent extends BaseComponent {\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n}\n~~~\nThe initializer with default's is not optional, you must provide an object that matches the generic.\nView Models\nFor a nice view decorators applied to class properties control the appearance.\n~~~\nexport class Model {\n  @Hidden()\n  id: number = 0;\n  @Required()\n  name: string = '';\n}\n@CustomElement('app-main')\n@Properties()\n@ViewModel(Model)\nexport class MainComponent extends BaseComponent {\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n}\n~~~\nWithin the component, this is now present. \n~~~\nthis.modelState = {\n  isValid: boolean,\n  isPresent: boolean,\n  errors: { [key: string]: string },\n  model: Model\n}\n~~~\nIn the above definition this.props.data contains an actual model. It's supervised. After render this.modelState helds the state of the model.\nServices\nWant to access an injectable service?\n~~~\n@CustomElement('app-main')\n@InjectService(ServiceClass1)\n@InjectService(ServiceClass2)\nexport class MainComponent extends BaseComponent {\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n  protected async render() {\n    let data = await this.services().callAnyServiceFunctionHereAsync();\n  }\n}\n~~~\n\nAsync is an option, can by sync, too.\n\nthis.services is a function, that returns an instance of the service. Services are singleton by default.\nRecap\nIs it worth coding with NYAF and vanilla JS? For smaller projects and for apps that must load quickly, yes.\nThe zipped package of the lib is 7 KBytes. Expanded just 23 KBytes.\nHowever, compared with React or Angular it's a lot simpler. Compared to Vue it's simpler and even smaller, but the delta is not that thrilling.\nRestrictions\nThe package runs, if there are no polyfills, only with ES2015. This limits the usage to any modern browser. It's pretty bold in Electron projects.\nHow to use\nPrepare a project\nInstall the package:\n~~~\nnpm i nyaf -S\n~~~\nCreate a file main.ts in the src folder that looks like this:\n~~~\nimport { globalProvider } from 'nyaf';\nimport { MainComponent } from './main.component';\nglobalProvider.bootstrap({\n  components: [MainComponent],\n});\n~~~\nCreate file main.component.ts in the same folder. Fill this content in:\n~~~\nimport { BaseComponent, ComponentData } from 'nyaf';\nimport JSX, { CustomElement } from 'nyaf';\n@CustomElement('app-main')\nexport class MainComponent extends BaseComponent {\nconstructor() {\n    super();\n}\n\nprotected getData(): ComponentData {\n    return null;\n}\n\nstatic get observedAttributes() {\n    return [];\n}\n\nrender() {\n    return (\n        \n    Demo\n    Hello NYAF\n        \n    );\n}}\n~~~\nCreate a file named index.html in the very same folder an fill it like this:\n~~~\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  Hello NYAF\n\n\n  Hell NYAF\n  \n\n\n~~~\n\nSetup\nNow, because it's based on TypeScript, it's very recommended to use WebPack and TypeScript.\nThe tsconfig.json looks like this:\n~~~\n~~~\nThe webpack.config.json looks like this:\n~~~\n~~~\nThe package.json gets an entry in scripts section:\n~~~\nbuild: \"webpack\",\n~~~\nBuild\nNow, on command line, just type npm run build.\nTo start webpack's dev server type:\n~~~\nnpm start\n~~~\nAn now enjoy writing a component based SPA with only very few KB of lib code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Joerg Krause\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
